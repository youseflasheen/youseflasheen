<summary><b>Hand Gesture Recognition for ASL</b></summary>
<br>
Engineered an end-to-end system to recognize 5 American Sign Language gestures from a webcam feed. The system uses OpenCV/MediaPipe for video processing and a TensorFlow model for classification, deployed as a Flask web app for live predictions.

<details>
<summary><b>Speech Command Recognition (>95% Accuracy)</b></summary>
<br>
Built a speech recognition model for 5 key commands, securing over 95% accuracy by converting raw audio into MFCC features for a custom CNN. The logic was packaged into a polished command-line interface (CLI) with features like countdown recording and instant feedback.
